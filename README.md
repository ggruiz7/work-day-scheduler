## A simple work day planner app

Type your to do list for the day into the the input boxes, marked my military time for a '9-5' work day, and click save for each task.

### Features:

- Current day is displayed at the top of the calander.
- Scrolling down presents you with different timeblcoks for standard business hours.
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.
- Clicking in the time block allows you to enter an event.
- Clicking save, saves the text for that event in local storage.
- Saved events persist through page refresh.
